# About Me

Hi, I’m Robin, a data science student interested in analytics, machine learning, and applied data projects.

I’m especially interested in how raw data can be transformed into insights that explain patterns, behaviours, and real-world phenomena. I enjoy working across the full data science pipeline — from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to modelling and communicating results.

This GitHub showcases selected academic and personal projects, including data analytics, machine learning, and computer vision work.
